title: Halley's Comet

Peter Cole recently posted that [Haley's Comet had reached aphelion](https://telescoper.blog/2023/12/11/the-return-of-halleys-comet/) and was beginning its return to the inner solar system.  This reminded me of one of my earliest astronomy memories.

I was standing outside in our backyard in suburban New Jersey on a cold, wintry night when I was 8 years old looking for Halley's Comet.  With the help of my Mom, we pointed the small, refractor telescope that I had gotten that Christmas around the sky until we had found the comet. 

I obviously always had an early interest in astronomy, but at that time, I had no idea where that would lead or where I would be at now.  But I really appreciate my Mom standing outside in the backyard while we looked for Halley's Comet on that cold night. 

I hope I will have another chance to observe it again in 2061.
