title:  Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies--A critical phase in the evolution of dwarf elliptical galaxies
---

An important test of galaxy evolution theory is to connect populations
of galaxies that we see in the past to galaxies observed in the nearby
Universe: What were the progenitors of the spiral, elliptical, and
dwarf galaxies that we observed today?  The most numerous type of
galaxy observed are dwarf galaxies.  They are believed to be the basic
building blocks that form larger galaxies.  In the largest structures
in the Universe, dwarf elliptical galaxies are the most numerous type
of dwarf galaxies.  These galaxies are small and dead: they have lost
all of their gas and are no longer forming stars.  But how did they
end up in clusters and in this state?

Well, in all likelihood, these galaxies have been falling into
clusters since the beginning of time where the dense environment in
galaxy clusters triggers a burst of star formation signaling the end
of their lives.  This hypothesis is based on observations of Luminous
Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) -- a population of galaxies bursting
with star formation seen primarily when the Universe was half its
current age.

What are LCBGs?  They are compact galaxies original discovered by Koo
& Kron in the 1980s.  Follow-up observations indicated that the
typical sizes of LCBGs were 2 kpc, similar to the Magellanic Clouds,
but they had magnitudes of M_B = -21, similar to the Milky Way.  LCBGs
typically have extremely blue colors and much higher star formation
rates than what is expected for their sizes. 

Now, when we look for LCBGs in galaxy clusters, and we were looking at
the largest galaxy clusters that are known, we found these clusters
had far more LCBGs than one would expect based on their density in the
field.  The population of LCBGs in clusters was *enhanced* as compared
to the field similar to the *enhanced* number of dwarf elliptical
galaxies seen in local galaxy clusters.  More so than that, the
distribution of LCBGs in clustes, both in space and velocity, seems to
indicate that they are recent arrivals ot the cluster environment.

In our most recent work, we found the cluster LCBGs were very similar
to field LCBGs and had similar properties to local dwarf elliptical
galaxies.  As compared to dwarf elliptical galaxies, LCBGs had a
similar size, dynamic mass, and chemical abundance.  If we make some
reasonable assumptions about their accretion rate and how the dense
cluster environment effects LCBGs over time, we can compare how the
luminosity function, the number of objects per magnitude, of LCBGs
compares to dwarf elliptical galaxies.  As can be seen below, between
30-75% of dwarf ellipticals likely went through an LCBG phase in the
last 8 Billion years.

Many dwarf elliptical galaxies in nearby clusters do show evidence for
recent in-fall and past bursts of star formation.  This is consistent
with what we find in LCBGs.  

Nonetheless, we did find some interesting results.  Most LCBGs in
clusters had a very close neighbor and approximately 10% of LCBGs are
expected to merge with that neighbor.  Furthermore, 30% of LCBGs
showed evidence for either obscurred star formation and/or a complex
burst of star formation.  These are two interesting areas to follow-up
to determine how LCBGs might evolve in the future.
