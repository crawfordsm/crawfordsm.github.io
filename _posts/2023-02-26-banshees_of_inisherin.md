title: The Banshees of Inisherin
---

This film had fantastic acting and cinematography, but it should have come with a content warning for mental health, animal cruelty, suicide, and repression.  Based on the trailer, I was not prepared for the depths of despair and depression that this film would deal with.  I think I was prepared for a dark comedy, but the rapid transition to a tragedy was shocking.  I should have better remembered how I felt at the end of In Bruges. 

With *everything* in the world today, I generally have tended towards entertainment in my films and books. At the same time, it has been a long time since I watched something that made me want to write about it even if it is just as a warning to others.

And despite the turns of the story, the lyrics of the dialogue and the emerald shores and the pints of Guinness did make me want to take another trip to Ireland.
