I am an astronomer currently working at the South Africa Astronomical Observatory primarily with the Southern African Large Telescope.   I have a wide range of research interests and like to dabble in a lot of different topics, but I focus primarily on galaxy evolution and observational cosmology.  

Nowadays, I mainly code in python, but I still use vi. 

When not working, I spend my time running, playing Ultimate Frisbee, reading, and traveling.
